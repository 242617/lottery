# lottery

Lottery service instantly generates random private keys for Ethereum network, checks it's balanse and if it's not zero makes a transaction to given wallet.

It's like lottery â€“ choose random number, check whether it's won and grab your prize!

P.S. Obviously there is no possibility to generate the existing private key or catch the collision, so it's just a joke.
